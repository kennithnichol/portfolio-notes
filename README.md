# Portfolio Notes

This repo documents the planning, decisions, and development of my personal portfolio [kennithnichol.com](https://kennithnichol.com).

It includes:
- Build logs and milestone notes
- Draft content for pages like About, Hire Me, and Projects
- Design and messaging iterations
- Ideas, todos, and architecture plans for future updates

This repo is part of a personal practice to keep work visible, thoughtful, and improvable over time.
