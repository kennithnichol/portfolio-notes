# Project Decisions

A log of key decisions, tech tradeoffs, and design choices made while building my portfolio.

## Domain strategy

**Primary domain:** `kennithnichol.com`
** Rationale:** Global appeal, easy to remember, professional branding.
`.ca` held and redirected for regional trust and possibly future use.

## Hugo vs Astro

**Chose Hugo** for site generator
**Rationale:**
- Wanted Golang practice
- Static speed and simplicity
- Deep control over layout and content

---

## Repository Structure

- Hugo project lives in `portfolio-site`
- Case studies and emta notes separated for clarity
- Might consider bringing case study Markdown into Hugo later, once templated
